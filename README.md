# OpenInsure
The Open Source Insurance API
We are starting with with OpenInvest but soon would like to add OpenInsure. If you have a business use for OpenInsure, please [fill out our survey](http://survey.openfulcrum.com) because we are always on the look-out for expanding the partner ecosystem around OpenFulcrum and co-creating new solutions.

# Collaboration with OpenInsurance.io
OpenFulcrum is happy to announce that they are collaborating with the Open Insurance Initiative around defining open source insurance APIs.
